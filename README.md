Body Section:

Container: Bootstrap container class to center content.
Card: Bootstrap card component to structure the layout.
Form: Contains input fields for amount, "from" currency, "to" currency, and a convert button.
Result Div: Placeholder for displaying conversion result.
Script:

Includes the JavaScript file main.js for currency conversion logic.

JavaScript Structure:
1. **DOMContentLoaded Event Listener**:
   - The `DOMContentLoaded` event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

2. **Variables**:
   - `form`, `amountInput`, `fromCurrency`, `toCurrency`, and `resultDiv` are references to elements in the HTML document.

3. **Currency Options**:
   - An array named `currencies` contains objects representing different currencies. Each currency object has properties `code` (currency code) and `name` (currency name).

4. **Populating Select Dropdowns**:
   - The `forEach` loop iterates over the `currencies` array and dynamically creates `<option>` elements for both "From" and "To" select dropdowns.
   - Each option's `textContent` is set to display both the currency code and name.

5. **Form Submission Handling**:
   - An event listener is attached to the form's submit event.
   - When the form is submitted, it prevents the default form submission behavior.
   - It retrieves the amount, "from" currency, and "to" currency selected by the user.
   - If any field is empty, it displays a message asking the user to fill in all fields.

6. **Conversion Rates**:
   - Placeholder conversion rates are defined in the `conversionRates` object. This object represents conversion rates from one currency to another.
   - Note: These rates are arbitrary and should typically be fetched from an API.

7. **Performing Conversion**:
   - The conversion is performed by multiplying the amount by the conversion rate (`amount * conversionRates[from][to]`).
   - The result is then displayed in the `resultDiv`.

This JavaScript code dynamically populates the currency dropdowns and handles currency conversion based on user input.
